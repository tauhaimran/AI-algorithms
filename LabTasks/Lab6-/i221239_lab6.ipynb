        "# **Task 1 : Delivery Route Optimization with Beam Search**\n",
        "\n",
        "A delivery company has multiple trucks, each capable of carrying a set number of packages. Your goal is to assign packages to trucks in a way that minimizes the total delivery time. Due to the large number of possible assignments, you will use Local Beam Search to efficiently explore the best delivery assignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Input:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A list of N packages, each with a specific delivery time (in minutes).\n",
        "    - Example: packages = [20, 35, 10, 25, 40, 15, 30, 22]\n",
        "- A set of M trucks.\n",
        "    - Example: M = 3\n",

        "Best Package-Truck Assignment:\n",
        "Truck 1: [20, 35]  --> Total Time: 55 minutes\n",

        "- Keep only the k-best states at each step (k = beam width).\n",

        "### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize Parameters**  \n",
        "   - Read **N packages**, **M trucks**, and **Beam Width (k)**.  \n",
        "   - Start with `k` initial states by assigning the first few packages in different ways.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterate Until All Packages Are Assigned**  \n",
        "   - For each state in the beam, generate new states by assigning the next package to any truck.  \n",
        "   - Compute **makespan** for each state:  \n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     Makespan = max(total delivery time of any truck)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - Keep only the `k` best states (lowest makespan).  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Terminate & Output Best Assignment**  \n",
        "   - Once all packages are assigned, return the state with the **minimum makespan**.  \n",
        "   - Output **truck assignments** and **total delivery time per truck**.  \n",
